        "bin/" directory before creating suymlinks to the allowed commands.

EXAMPLES
    Create user dummy, allow it to run commands date(1), ls(1) and ssh(1)
    but don't actually do anything:

        restricted-shell-create --test dummy date ls ssh

    Same, but clean all other command that user may have had access to from
    last setup:

        restricted-shell-create --test --init dummy date ls ssh

    Overwrite account files while creating the restricted shell environment:

        restricted-shell-create --force --init dummy date ls ssh
