=head1 NAME

restricted-shell-create - create a restricted shell environment using rbash

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  restricted-shell-create [options] <login name> [list of allowed commands]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Program to create a restricted shell environment using C</bin/rbash>.
Creates login name if it does not exist. If no password is specified
for the login, default is set to I<password>.

Program can only be run by root and it must be run on a host,
that has direct access to the user's home; not on a host that NFS
mounts /home. The list of allowed commands must be along I<PATH> or
written using full path names.

Remember that the acocunt is only as secure as the choice of
commands. Don't let anyone run commands that would allow escaping
to a shell, like editors (emacs, vi) or mail programs (mutt) etc.

=head2 Further Reading

For real hard security, someone reminded in the Net: "honestly a
restricted shells are depreciated, you should be using tools such as
apparmor, selinux, grsecurity or virtualization as it is rather
trivial to break out of rbash."

In Debian systems, see package I<jailer> to create chrooted
environments.

To restrict access from certain hosts and private ssh keys. See
Linux Journal article I<Paranoid Penguin - Managing SSH for
Scripts and cron Jobs> at
<http://www.linuxjournal.com/magazine/paranoid-penguin-managing-ssh-scripts-and-cron-jobs?page=0,0>

A good article about overwiev to securing logins can be found at
<http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/restricting-unix-users>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-d, --homeroot>

The absolute path of system home directory root. defaults to /home.

=item B<-D, --debug>

Activate shell debug.

=item B<-f, --force>

Allow destructive changes, like overwriting files while copying
bash startup to user's home directory.

=item B<-g, --group>

If provided, passed to B<usedadd(1)> command if user does not
exist.

=item B<-i, --init>

Clean initialization. Delete all previous commands from user's
c<bin/> directory before creating suymlinks to the allowed
commands.

=item B<-o, --chown USER:GROUP>

Set permissions to USER:GROUP. Defaults to I<root:root>.

=item B<-p, --password PASSWORD>

Set login password to PASSWORD. If this options is not set, use
default value of I<password> during call to adduser(8).

=item B<-s, --shell PROGRAM>

Set user's shell to PROGRAM. Defualts to c</bin/rbash>.

=item B<-t, --test>

Show what commands would be run. Do not actually do anything.

=item B<-v, --verbose>

Be verbose.

=item B<-v, --version>

Display version information and exit.

=item B<-h, --help>

Display short help.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Create user I<dummy>, allow it to run commands date(1), ls(1) and
ssh(1) but don't actually do anything:

    restricted-shell-create --test dummy date ls ssh

Same, but clean all other command that user I<dummy> may have had
access to from last setup:

    restricted-shell-create --test --init dummy date ls ssh

Overwrite account files for user I<dummy> while creating the
restricted shell environment:

    restricted-shell-create --force --init dummy date ls ssh

Make your personal modifications as needed, like allowing only
ssh key based access. The authorized_keys file is a file that
contains the public identities, or public keys, of users who can
log in to the account by using public key authentication:

    cd ~dummy
    $EDITOR .ssh/authorize_keys

    # OR, append key to the host remotedly
    cat ~/.ssh/key.pub | ssh -l root HOST "cd ~dummy; cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"

A typical case for restricted shell is to allow users to access
Subversion Version Control Server at remote host in a secure manner.
The server process typicaly runs on account I<svn> so we create a
restricted login below. For more information see SVN Book section
I<Tunneling over SSH> at
<http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/index.html>.

    # ... AT SVN SERVER

    restricted-shell-create --init svn svnserve
    cd ~svn
    chown -R root:svn .bash* .ssh/

    cd .ssh

    # Make a unique ssh key for each user
    ssh-keygen -t dsa -f user1
    ssh-keygen -t dsa -f user2

    # Add keys
    cat user1.pub user2.pub >> authorized_keys

    # Edit each user's key like this (all in one line):
    # command=”svnserve --root=/var/svn/project/ --tunnel –-tunnel-user=user1″,no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty <KEY DATA>

    $EDITOR authorized_keys

    # ... AT SVN CLIENT SIDE

    $EDITOR $HOME/.subversion/config

    # Under the "[tunnels]". The svn URLs are like "svn+secure://HOST/dir"
    # -l = Log in as "svn"
    # -i = use specific key

    secure = /usr/bin/ssh -l svn -i /home/user1/.ssh/user1

=head1 BUGS

The C<restricted> behavior is not handled in rbash(1) correctly if you
su(1) to the account. See <http://bugs.debian.org/411997>. You must
use standard login(1) to get the expected behavior.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

None.

=head1 FILES

Directory C</ust/share/restricted-shell-rbash> contains template
field. These are not user editable as they are overwritten by
next install. If you want to supply your own, copy them over to
user directory after this program.

=head1 STANDARDS

None.
